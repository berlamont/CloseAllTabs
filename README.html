<ul>
<li>Closes all open documents</li>
<li>Collapses nodes in Solution Explorer</li>
<li>Activates Solution Explorer</li>

<h3 id="close-open-documents">Close open documents</h3>
<p>All open documents will be closed when the solution closes. This makes
solution load faster for the next time you open it.</p>
<h3 id="collapse-nodes-in-solution-explorer">Collapse nodes in Solution Explorer</h3>
<p>Projects and solutions can quickly become noisy to look at when folders
and nested files are expanded in Solution Explorer.</p>
<p>This extension automatically collapses all expanded nodes except for
project nodes.</p>
<p><img src="art/before-after.png" alt="Before and after" /></p>
<p>Be default, solution folders are collapsed as well, but that can be
changed in the options.</p>
<h3 id="activates-solution-explorer">Activates Solution Explorer</h3>
<p>Ensures that Solution Explorer is the active tool window when you open
a solution.</p>
<p>This is useful if you're tool window layout docks Solution Explorer
with other tool windows in the same location.</p>

<h3 id="delete-bin-and-obj-folders">Delete <em>bin</em> and <em>obj</em> folders</h3>
<p>This options will delete <em>bin</em> and <em>obj</em> folders from all projects in
the solution on close.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>, no files under source control will be deleted by this feature.</p>
<p>The <em>bin</em> and <em>obj</em> folders are usually safe to delete since they
are automatically generated when the solution/project is being build by
Visual Studio/MSBuild.</p>
<p>This feature is off by default, but can easily be enabled in the
settings.</p>
<h3 id="settings">Settings</h3>
<p>Disable the individual features easily from the <strong>Tools -&gt; Options</strong>
dialog.</p>
